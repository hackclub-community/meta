`@hackclub-community` is a GitHub organization that works alongside the `@hackclub` organization.

The `@hackclub` organization holds all the official and Hack Club HQ-sanctioned projects from the HCB platform to the YSWS directory.

The `@hackclub-community` organization is the community playground and can host any projects that benefit from a shared ownership, without being strict with permissions.
